# Keyboard-Midi-Playground

This project is an experimental playground to use the computer's keyboard as a
midi player. It's inspired by Launchpad's note mode, and the idea is to turn
the keyboard into a real instrument. You can define scales, root notes, modes
(single note, chord, chord 7) and each key will behave differently, allowing
you to explore melody and chords.

Everything is written in Rust using SDL for the interface. There is a lot
to improve since this was my first Rust project.
